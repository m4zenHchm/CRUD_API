# Laravel User CRUD API

This folder contains only the important files for the User CRUD API built using Laravel:

- `routes/api.php` → defines the API routes
- `app/Http/Controllers/AuthController.php` → handles create, read, update, delete logic
- `app/Models/User.php` → user model
- `database/migrations/xxxx_xx_xx_create_users_table.php` → user table structure

Tested using Postman. Connected to a MySQL database.
